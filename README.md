ActiveCampaign Codeigneter Librery is simple integration with ActiveCampaign to codeigniter. So we can use it's function to integrate with ActiveCampaign 

  - copy and paste it in codigneter home folder
  - Set URL and key in config file
  - load library
  - use function(s)

### First version!

  - Simple interface and functions
  - Test connection, Get contacts, Add Contact, Get Lists

You can also:
  - Set Defult list
  - Getting Error or Result messaging



### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [ActiveCampaign php SDK](https://github.com/ActiveCampaign/activecampaign-api-php) - Core fetures to use librery!
* [codeigniter](https://codeigniter.com/) - As a platform!

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/pathusutariya/ActiveCampaign-Codeigniter-Library) on GitHub.

$ Copy and paste in home folder, Or application folder
$ Add config setting in `activecampaign.php` file

```
