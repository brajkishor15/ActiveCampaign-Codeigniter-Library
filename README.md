ActiveCampaign Codeigniter Library is simple integration with ActiveCampaign to Codeigniter. So we can use its function to integrate with ActiveCampaign

  - copy and paste it in Codeigniter home folder
  - Set URL and key in config file
  - load library
  - use function(s)

### First version!

  - Simple interface and functions
  - Test connection, Get contacts, Add Contact, Get Lists

You can also:
  - Set Default list
  - Getting Error or Result messaging



### Tech

ActiveCampaign Library uses some open source projects to work correctly:

* [ActiveCampaign php SDK](https://github.com/ActiveCampaign/activecampaign-api-php) - Core fetures to use librery!
* [codeigniter](https://codeigniter.com/) - As a platform!

And of course ActiveCampaign-Codeigniter-Library itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/pathusutariya/ActiveCampaign-Codeigniter-Library) on GitHub.

### Installation

```txt
Copy and paste in the home folder, Or application folder
Add config setting in `activecampaign.php` file
Load this library where you want to use it
```

Want to contribute? Great! Each and every help will be appreciated.

### Todos
